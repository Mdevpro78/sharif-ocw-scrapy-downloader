## :material-alert-decagram: Challenges & Solutions

!!! danger "Challenge: Performance Bottleneck"

    **Issue**: API endpoints experiencing >500ms response times under load.

    **Solution**: Implemented Redis caching layer and query optimization, reducing response times to \<85ms.

!!! danger "Challenge: Complex User Requirements"

    **Issue**: Users needed intuitive interface for complex data operations.

    **Solution**: Developed interactive prototype with user testing, resulting in 92% user satisfaction.

## :material-school: Lessons Learned

=== "Technical"

    !!! success "Optimized Database Queries"

        Early index planning and query optimization prevented performance issues later in the project.

    !!! success "Component Architecture"

        Breaking UI into small, reusable components accelerated development in later sprints.

=== "Business"

    !!! tip "Stakeholder Communication"

        Weekly demos with stakeholders prevented requirement misalignment and reduced rework.

    !!! tip "MVP Approach"

        Focusing on core features for initial launch enabled faster time-to-market with high user satisfaction.
