# Past Performance Documentation

!!! info "Purpose"

    This section contains templates and examples for documenting project past performance, lessons learned, and key metrics. Use these templates to create comprehensive project retrospectives that can inform future projects.

## Available Templates

### Comprehensive Template

The [Comprehensive Template](templates/past-performance-comprehensive.md) provides a complete framework for documenting all aspects of a project's performance including:

- Project metadata and context
- Objectives, OKRs, and KPIs
- Technical and business challenges
- Lessons learned
- Resource utilization
- Timeline visualization
- Success factors and areas for improvement

### Other Templates

- [Template 01](templates/past-performance-temp-01.md) - Basic project review template
- [Template 02](templates/past-performance-temp-02.md) - Simplified performance report

## How to Use

1. Copy the appropriate template to a new file in your project documentation
2. Fill in all relevant sections with your project's information
3. Add visualizations where appropriate (timelines, charts, etc.)
4. Review with stakeholders before finalizing

## Best Practices

- Document lessons learned as soon as possible after encountering challenges
- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback
- Be honest about challenges and failures - they provide the most valuable learning
- Update the performance document throughout the project lifecycle, not just at the end
- Include input from all team members and stakeholders for a comprehensive view
