# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

!!! info "About ADRs"

    Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during the development of this project. They provide context, rationale, and consequences for each decision.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision, including its context and consequences. ADRs are immutable once accepted, providing a historical record of the project's evolution.

:material-format-list-checks: **ADRs help us:**

- Document important decisions for future reference
- Communicate the rationale behind decisions to team members
- Onboard new team members by providing architectural context
- Track the evolution of the system architecture over time

## ADR Process

:material-timeline: The lifecycle of an ADR follows these stages:

1. :material-pencil: **Proposed** - Initial draft for discussion
2. :material-check-circle: **Accepted** - Approved and implemented
3. :material-close-circle: **Rejected** - Considered but not implemented
4. :material-archive: **Deprecated** - No longer relevant but kept for historical purposes
5. :material-swap-horizontal: **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer ADR

## Using This Template

To create a new ADR, copy the [comprehensive template](templates/adr-comprehensive-template.md) and follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `docs/architecture/decisions/` directory
2. Name it with a sequential number and descriptive title (e.g., `adr-0001-use-postgresql.md`)
3. Fill in all relevant sections of the template
4. Submit for review through the standard process

## ADR Index

:material-file-document-multiple: Below is a list of all Architecture Decision Records for this project:
