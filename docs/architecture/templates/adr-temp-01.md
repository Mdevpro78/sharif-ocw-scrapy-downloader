## \[ADR Number\]: [Short Title of Decision]

**Status:** :material-check-circle:{ .md-color--green } Proposed / :material-check-circle:{ .md-color--green } Accepted / :material-alert-circle:{ .md-color--orange } Deprecated / :material-close-circle:{ .md-color--red } Superseded

## Context and Problem Statement

[:material-book-open-page-variant: Context]{ .md-color--blue }

\[Clearly and concisely describe the context and background of the decision. What is the issue or problem that needs to be addressed? What are the relevant facts and circumstances? Avoid jargon and be specific. This should be understandable to someone unfamiliar with the project, but familiar with the domain. Use diagrams if they help explain the context. Focus on *why* a decision is needed, not *what* the decision is.\]

[:material-puzzle: Problem Statement]{ .md-color--blue }

[A concise statement of the problem. This should be a single sentence or a very short paragraph. It should be clear what problem this ADR is trying to solve.]

## Drivers

[:material-steering: Drivers]{ .md-color--blue }

\[List the key drivers influencing this decision. Categorize them as *Technical* or *Business*. Use bullet points for clarity. These are the "forces" at play.\]

- **Technical:**
    - [Technical Driver 1: e.g., Scalability requirements]
    - [Technical Driver 2: e.g., Performance targets]
    - [Technical Driver 3: e.g., Existing technology stack]
- **Business:**
    - [Business Driver 1: e.g., Time-to-market constraints]
    - [Business Driver 2: e.g., Budget limitations]
    - [Business Driver 3: e.g., Regulatory compliance]

## Constraints

[:material-block-helper: Constraints]{ .md-color--blue }

[List any constraints that limit the possible solutions. These are non-negotiable limitations. Use bullet points.]

- [Constraint 1: e.g., Must use existing database]
- [Constraint 2: e.g., Must be deployable on platform X]

## Objectives

[:material-target: Objectives]{ .md-color--blue }

[List the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives that the chosen solution should achieve. Use bullet points.]
