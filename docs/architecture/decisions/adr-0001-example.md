## Context and Problem Statement

:material-information: Our application currently uses a monolithic architecture which is becoming difficult to scale and maintain as the system grows. We need to decide on an approach to break down the monolith into more manageable components.

- The current monolithic application handles user authentication, business logic, and data storage in a tightly coupled manner
- Development velocity has decreased as the codebase grows
- Scaling the application requires scaling the entire monolith, even when only specific components need additional resources
- Deploying changes is becoming risky and time-consuming

## Decision Drivers

### Business Drivers

:material-briefcase: Business factors influencing this decision:

- :material-currency-usd: **Cost Efficiency**: Need to optimize infrastructure costs by scaling components independently
- :material-account-group: **Team Structure**: Multiple teams need to work on different parts of the application simultaneously
- :material-chart-timeline-variant: **Time to Market**: Need to reduce deployment cycles and enable faster feature delivery

### Technical Drivers

:material-code-tags: Technical factors influencing this decision:

- :material-server: **Scalability**: Need to scale different components independently based on load
- :material-database: **Data Management**: Need to isolate data access patterns for different components
- :material-cloud: **Cloud Migration**: Planning to move from on-premises to cloud infrastructure

## Constraints

:material-lock: Constraints that limit our options:

- **Budget**: Limited budget for the transformation project
- **Timeline**: Need to complete the initial phase within 6 months
- **Legacy Integration**: Must maintain compatibility with existing legacy systems

## Objectives

:material-target: What we aim to achieve with this decision:

- **Improved Scalability**: Enable independent scaling of application components
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Make the codebase more manageable and easier to understand
- **Faster Deployments**: Reduce deployment time and risk

## Forces

:material-arrow-decision: Forces at play that influence the decision:

- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated technical debt in the current monolith
- **Team Expertise**: Current team expertise in different architectural patterns
- **Operational Complexity**: Trade-off between development simplicity and operational complexity

## Considered Options

:material-format-list-bulleted: Options considered to address the problem:

- **Option 1**: [Microservices Architecture](#option-1-microservices-architecture)
- **Option 2**: [Modular Monolith](#option-2-modular-monolith)
- **Option 3**: [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)](#option-3-service-oriented-architecture-soa)

### Option 1: Microservices Architecture

:material-lightbulb: Decompose the application into small, independently deployable services that communicate over a network.

#### Pros

:material-check-circle: Advantages of this option:

- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can be scaled independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can develop, deploy, and scale their services independently

#### Cons

:material-alert-circle: Disadvantages of this option:

- **Operational Complexity**: Increased complexity in deployment, monitoring, and management
- **Network Latency**: Communication between services introduces network latency
- **Learning Curve**: Steep learning curve for the development team

#### Mitigation Strategies

:material-shield: Strategies to mitigate the cons:

- **For Operational Complexity**: Invest in robust DevOps practices and tools
- **For Network Latency**: Implement caching and asynchronous communication where appropriate
- **For Learning Curve**: Provide training and start with a small pilot project

### Option 2: Modular Monolith

:material-lightbulb: Restructure the monolith into well-defined modules with clear boundaries while keeping it as a single deployable unit.

#### Pros

:material-check-circle: Advantages of this option:

- **Simplified Operations**: Single deployment unit is easier to manage
- **Lower Complexity**: Avoids the distributed systems challenges of microservices
- **Easier Transition**: More gradual path from the current monolith

#### Cons

:material-alert-circle: Disadvantages of this option:

- **Limited Scaling**: Still need to scale the entire application
- **Technology Constraints**: All modules must use compatible technologies
- **Deployment Coupling**: Changes to one module require redeploying everything

#### Mitigation Strategies

:material-shield: Strategies to mitigate the cons:

- **For Limited Scaling**: Design modules to be stateless where possible
- **For Technology Constraints**: Establish clear interfaces between modules
- **For Deployment Coupling**: Implement feature toggles and robust testing

### Option 3: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

:material-lightbulb: Organize the application into medium-grained services that share a common communication layer.

#### Pros

:material-check-circle: Advantages of this option:

- **Balanced Approach**: Middle ground between monolith and microservices
- **Reuse**: Services can be reused across different parts of the application
- **Governance**: Centralized governance and standards

#### Cons

:material-alert-circle: Disadvantages of this option:

- **Complex Middleware**: Often requires complex middleware (ESB)
- **Potential Bottlenecks**: Shared services can become bottlenecks
- **Integration Challenges**: Service integration can be complex

#### Mitigation Strategies

:material-shield: Strategies to mitigate the cons:

- **For Complex Middleware**: Use lightweight integration approaches where possible
- **For Potential Bottlenecks**: Design for appropriate granularity and scalability
- **For Integration Challenges**: Establish clear service contracts and versioning policies
